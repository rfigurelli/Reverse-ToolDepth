## Executive Summary

What if intelligence could be cultivated by encouraging systems to build tools that, in turn, build other tools? **Reverse ToolDepth** proposes a reference architecture that transforms the Recursive Instrumental Index (RII) from a passive metric into an active engine of intelligent behavior. Inspired by the recursive strategies found in human innovation, strategic planning, and software composition \[1]\[3], this model treats intelligence not as a fixed capability, but as an evolving structure built through instrumental layering.

This paper outlines a design framework for systems that grow in cognitive depth by recursively producing and reusing tools. By rewarding instrumental chains and enabling systems to remember, evaluate, and expand their own tool-making history, Reverse ToolDepth provides a pathway toward more adaptive, transparent, and general-purpose intelligence.

An intuitive parallel comes from chess. Expert players plan multiple moves ahead, not just reacting to the current board but anticipating how each move unlocks future possibilities. Each move acts as a conceptual "tool" for the next, forming a chain of foresight and strategy \[2]. Reverse ToolDepth envisions intelligent systems that reason this way—by constructing instrumental pathways where current actions create the means for future ones.

Beyond abstract theory, this approach has practical implications across AI architecture, robotics, software engineering, and learning systems. It offers benchmarks for intelligent progression, tools for explainability, and a mechanism for aligning artificial capabilities with the recursive ingenuity observed in natural cognition.What if intelligence could be cultivated by encouraging systems to build tools that, in turn, build other tools? **Reverse ToolDepth** proposes a reference architecture that transforms the Recursive Instrumental Index (RII) from a passive metric into an active engine of intelligent behavior.

Inspired by how humans and advanced agents recursively deepen their toolsets to solve more complex problems \[1]\[3], this paper suggests a minimal, modular, and self-reinforcing system for cultivating emergent cognitive depth.
